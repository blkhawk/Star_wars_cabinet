# Summary

Spent way to much of my childhood on this classic arcade game, unfortunately this is as close as I'll get to owning one now. Thanks to 3D printing I can at least re-live those days in miniature.

Designed in sections that can be glued together and require no support when printing.

All artwork included. Print decals at 100% size at 300dpi (280mm high x 200mm wide)

When printing the decals please ensure 'Scale to fit media' is turned OFF as this will alter the print dimensions.

I printed my artwork on a sheet of self adhesive glossy inkjet vinyl.

Overhead window is a small piece of grey tinted acetate, dimensions for this are also included.

Assembled model measures (L)185mm x (H)150mm x (W)70mm.

This is approx. a 1:10 scale model, if you require a 1:12 scale model simply reduce the model and decals to 85%.

Enjoy fellow retro arcade fans.... and may the f..orget it :)
